# dndbot
A Discord bot for DnD-based games written in Go.

## (Temporary) Disclaimer
dndbot is currently under active development and is to be considered *very* unstable
slash not-working-at-all.

Feel free to browse the source as reference material and/or expand into your own bot.

If you want to contribute, do get in touch, though note that this is a fairly personal
project for the time being and I likely won't be interested in submissions until the
bot is in something resembling a stable and working state.
